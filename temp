# __Rules and Info__
### Rule 1: Community Safety
Please be mindful of the Discord Community Guidelines and the Discord Terms of Service. These can be found at:
https://discord.com/guidelines 
https://discord.com/terms

Dissemination of phishing links, fake Discord Nitro links, viruses, and other dangerous contents are forbidden. Coordinating brigades or raids on other communities is forbidden. Do not even joke about these.

The rules of Kessokucord applies to contents in all languages.
 
### Rule 2: Courtesy and Decency
Treat other Kessokucord members with respect in all channels and threads, text or voice. Inflammatory conducts are not tolerated in the server. These include but are not limited to: hate speech, slurs, harassment, bullying and encouraging others to harm themselves.

Slurs include the n-word with a soft ‘a’ at the end and the homophobic f-word which is used to refer to cigarettes in British English, using these words even in a non-offensive context will still result in enforcement.

Do not chat about wanting to break any of our rules, and do not incite others to do so.

### Rule 3: No Harmful/Explicit Content
Do not post disturbing or harmful content in the Discord server, such as gore or self-harm. Harmful content also applies to images, videos, or sounds that may harm other people (ex: a video that is loud with bright lights)

Suggestive artworks requiring spoiler flair under our unified NSFW ruleset should be posted with the spoiler flair. Any content violating our unified NSFW ruleset will be removed.

### Rule 4: Roleplayer's Paradise
Any roleplaying longer than a two-message chain should be contained to the appropriate opt-in roleplaying channels. To gain access to these channels, head over to ⁠<#1094655499129081940> channel and react to the appropriate emojis in the "Channel Access" section to assign yourself the "Roleplay Viewer" roll. At first, roleplay viewers will be able to view roleplay channels but not partake. Please read the rules of roleplay in rp-readme and then react to the rules, confirming you’ve read them carefully in order to receive full rp permissions.

### Rule 5: Spoilers
Please mark and title all forms of spoilers; use Discord’s native markup
`|| spoiler text ||` for text, and mark image spoilers when uploading spoiler images. Spoilers are best described as concrete plot details, rather than the existence of a character. For further information on spoilers, refer to: https://www.reddit.com/r/KessokuBand/wiki/spoiler_guidelines/

### Rule 6: Spam
Disruptive spamming is not tolerated. Examples of disruptive spam include but are not limited to: repetitive reposted messages, excessive pings to a user or staff, and mic or soundboard spam in voice channels. Moderators reserve the right to exercise discretion on when to enforce this rule.

### Rule 7: Citing Sources Is Encouraged
We strongly encourage users to source any artworks that they post whenever possible, as it helps the livelihood of the artists. A useful tool for reverse image searching is: https://saucenao.com/
